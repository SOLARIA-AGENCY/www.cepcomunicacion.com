/**
 * Calculate Campaign Metrics Hook
 *
 * PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL: Must handle 10,000 leads efficiently
 *
 * Calculates campaign analytics:
 * - total_leads: COUNT(leads WHERE campaign_id = this)
 * - total_conversions: COUNT(DISTINCT students with enrollments WHERE lead.campaign = this)
 * - conversion_rate: (total_conversions / total_leads) * 100
 * - cost_per_lead: budget / total_leads
 *
 * Performance Strategy:
 * - Single query with IN operator (no N+1 queries)
 * - Uses PostgreSQL COUNT with GROUP BY
 * - Target: <100ms for 10,000 leads
 *
 * Security Patterns:
 * - SP-001: Calculated fields are system-managed (immutable)
 * - SP-004: No business intelligence in logs
