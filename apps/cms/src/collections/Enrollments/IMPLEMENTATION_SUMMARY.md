## Security Patterns Applied

### SP-001: Immutable Fields with Defense in Depth

All immutable fields implement **3 layers of protection**:

#### Immutable Fields List
1. **created_by** - Audit trail integrity
2. **enrolled_at** - Historical accuracy
3. **confirmed_at** - Payment audit trail
4. **completed_at** - Academic record integrity
5. **cancelled_at** - Cancellation audit trail
6. **certificate_issued** - Once issued, cannot be revoked
7. **certificate_url** - Prevents certificate fraud

#### Layer 1: UX Protection
```typescript
admin: {
  readOnly: true, // Users cannot edit in UI
}
```

#### Layer 2: Security Protection
```typescript
access: {
  read: () => true,
  update: () => false, // API cannot modify via update endpoint
}
```

#### Layer 3: Business Logic Protection
```typescript
// Hook enforces immutability even if layers 1 & 2 bypassed
if (operation === 'update' && data.immutable_field !== originalDoc.immutable_field) {
  data.immutable_field = originalDoc.immutable_field; // Restore original
}
```

### SP-004: No PII in Logs

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE:**
- Students have PII (names, emails, phone numbers)
- **NEVER** log student details in hooks
- **ONLY** log IDs: enrollment.id, student.id, course_run.id

**Verification:**
All 6 hooks manually verified for PII compliance ✅

---

## Field-Level Access Control

### Financial Data Protection

The following fields require Admin or Gestor role:

```typescript
access: {
  read: () => true, // All authenticated users
  update: ({ req: { user } }) => {
    return ['admin', 'gestor'].includes(user.role);
  },
}
```

**Protected Financial Fields:**
- payment_status
- total_amount
- amount_paid
- financial_aid_applied
- financial_aid_amount
- financial_aid_status

**Rationale:** Financial data is sensitive and should only be modified by authorized administrators.

---

## Business Logic Implementation

### Status Workflow

```
pending ──payment──> confirmed ──complete──> completed
   │                     │
   └─────cancel──────────┴────> cancelled/withdrawn
```

**Rules:**
- `completed` is terminal (cannot transition to other states)
- Enforced in `captureEnrollmentTimestamps` hook

### Payment Status Auto-Calculation

```typescript
// Automatically calculated in validateFinancialData hook
if (amount_paid === 0) return 'pending';
if (amount_paid >= total_amount) return 'paid';
return 'partial';
```

**Prevents:** Manual manipulation of payment_status

### Capacity Management

```typescript
// In validateEnrollmentCapacity hook
if (current_enrollments >= max_students) {
  enrollment.status = 'waitlisted';
}

// In updateCourseRunEnrollmentCount hook (afterChange)
when status → 'confirmed': course_run.current_enrollments += 1
when 'confirmed' → 'cancelled': course_run.current_enrollments -= 1
```

**Real-time synchronization** between Enrollments and CourseRuns collections.

---

## Database Schema Alignment

The Payload collection is fully aligned with the PostgreSQL schema defined in:
`/infra/postgres/migrations/007_create_enrollments.sql`

### Key Constraints Enforced

1. **UNIQUE(student_id, course_run_id)**
   - One enrollment per student per course run
   - Enforced via Payload's unique validation

2. **CHECK Constraints**
   - amount_paid >= 0 ✅
   - total_amount >= 0 ✅
   - amount_paid <= total_amount ✅
   - financial_aid_amount >= 0 ✅
   - financial_aid_amount <= total_amount ✅
   - attendance_percentage 0-100 ✅
   - final_grade 0-100 ✅

3. **Foreign Keys**
   - student_id → students.id (CASCADE DELETE) ✅
   - course_run_id → course_runs.id (CASCADE DELETE) ✅
   - created_by → users.id (SET NULL ON DELETE) ✅

4. **Indexes Created**
   - idx_enrollments_student ✅
   - idx_enrollments_course_run ✅
   - idx_enrollments_status ✅
   - idx_enrollments_payment_status ✅
   - idx_enrollments_created_by ✅

---

## Integration Points

### With CourseRuns Collection
- **Capacity Validation:** Checks `CourseRun.current_enrollments` vs `CourseRun.max_students`
- **Real-time Updates:** Increments/decrements `current_enrollments` on status changes
- **Status Requirement:** CourseRun must be `enrollment_open` to accept enrollments

### With Students Collection
- **Current:** Using `leads` collection as temporary students
- **Production:** Should use dedicated `students` collection
- **Migration Path:** Create Students collection → migrate data → update relationship

### With Users Collection
- **Audit Trail:** `created_by` tracks enrollment creator
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions
- **SET NULL:** When user deleted, created_by becomes null

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Students Collection:** Currently using `leads` collection
   - **Impact:** Leads are not true students
   - **Resolution:** Create dedicated Students collection

2. **Delete Hook:** No `afterDelete` hook for enrollment count
   - **Impact:** Hard deletes don't update course_run.current_enrollments
   - **Mitigation:** Recommend setting status='cancelled' instead of delete

### Planned Enhancements
- [ ] Email notifications on status changes (confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- [ ] Automated certificate generation
- [ ] Payment gateway integration
- [ ] Installment payment plans
- [ ] Waitlist auto-promotion when spots open
- [ ] Student self-service enrollment portal
- [ ] Dedicated Students collection (highest priority)

## API Usage Examples

### Create Enrollment
```typescript
const enrollment = await payload.create({
  collection: 'enrollments',
  data: {
    student: 123,
    course_run: 456,
    status: 'pending',
    payment_status: 'pending',
    total_amount: 1000,
    amount_paid: 0,
  },
  user: currentUser,
});
```

### Confirm Enrollment
```typescript
const confirmed = await payload.update({
  collection: 'enrollments',
  id: enrollment.id,
  data: {
    status: 'confirmed',
    amount_paid: 1000,
  },
  user: adminUser,
});
// Auto-updates: payment_status = 'paid', confirmed_at = now()
// Side effect: course_run.current_enrollments += 1
```

### Query Enrollments
```typescript
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'enrollments',
  where: {
    course_run: { equals: 456 },
    status: { equals: 'confirmed' },
  },
  user: currentUser,
});
```
