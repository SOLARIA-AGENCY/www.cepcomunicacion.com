## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Preparation)
1. Review new structure
2. Validate all documentation links
3. Initialize package.json for monorepo
4. Set up Turborepo configuration

### Phase 1 Development
1. Create `/apps/api/` - Cloudflare Workers API
2. Create `/packages/database/` - Drizzle ORM schemas
3. Create `/packages/types/` - Shared TypeScript types
4. Set up development environment
5. Begin database implementation

### Ongoing
1. Update `DEVELOPMENT.md` with progress
2. Use `.claude/tasks/` for complex features
3. Maintain documentation in `/docs/`
4. Follow development methodology in `.claude/memories/`

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

**Old paths → New paths:**
```
/specs/                          → /docs/specs/
/SPEC_PROGRESS.md               → /docs/reports/SPEC_PROGRESS.md
/AUDIT_COMPLETENESS.md          → /docs/reports/AUDIT_COMPLETENESS.md
/RESUMEN_EJECUTIVO.md           → /docs/executive/RESUMEN_EJECUTIVO.md
/PROJECT_INDEX.md               → /docs/guides/PROJECT_INDEX.md
```

**New locations:**
```
Development tracking             → /DEVELOPMENT.md
Development methodology          → /.claude/memories/development-methodology.md
Application code (future)        → /apps/
Shared packages (future)         → /packages/
Infrastructure (future)          → /infra/
```

### For Links in Documentation

All internal links in moved files should be updated to reflect new paths. Priority updates:
1. Links in `/docs/guides/PROJECT_INDEX.md`
2. Links in `/docs/specs/README.md`
3. Cross-references between specifications

---

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Benefits Achieved
1. **Clean separation** between docs and code
2. **Professional structure** ready for monorepo development
3. **Clear organization** by document type (specs, reports, guides, executive)
4. **Development ready** with tracking and methodology in place
5. **Git-ready** with proper .gitignore
6. **Claude Code optimized** with memories and tasks structure

### ⚠️ Potential Issues
1. Internal links in documentation may need updates
2. Bookmarks to old paths will be broken
3. Any external references to old structure need updating

### ✅ Risk Mitigation
- All changes tracked in git
- Easy to revert if needed
- No files deleted, only moved
- Complete audit trail
